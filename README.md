It's all fair game, do what you want with it, but know you cannot do anything with this for monetary gain without removing any and all Sonic assets from the project. None of us own the IP. 
Also, do please credit me and the following if you create any projects with it. SuperSonic68. NotSoGreedy, LakeFeperd. While the Flipper Framework is my own work, it is built on the prior Unity engines of these taleneted developers.
