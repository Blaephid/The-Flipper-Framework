RTP can work in 2 modes:

1. 4 layer per pass
2. 8 layers in first pass

In first mode if you use more than 4 layers (up to 8), layers 4-7 will be realised in 2nd pass (AddPass shader).

In 2nd mode layers 0-7 will be rendered in single pass, layers 8-11 will be rendered in AddPass. We can't use more than 12 layers (result might be unpredictible).
In Deferred lighting you CAN'T use add passes due to missing Smoothness and occlusion blending (everything should be rendered in one pass - either 4 or 8 layers).
