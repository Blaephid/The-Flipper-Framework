Textures used in "2PM" vertex paint shaders for geometry blend.

Combined bumpmaps are made like this:
 1. open Window/Relief Tools/4 to 1 texture channel mixer
 2. target texture channels are:
     - R = A from 1st bumpmap
     - G = G from 1st bumpmap
     - B = A from 2st bumpmap
     - A = G from 2st bumpmap

Combined heightmap uses RG channels - you can make it using the same tool above
